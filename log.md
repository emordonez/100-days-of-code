# 100 Days Of Code &ndash; Log

## Day 0: April 12, 2021

**Today's progress**: Altered my website's Vue icon component to import SVGs automatically.

**Thoughts:** I need a regex refresher.
I can make sense of `require.context()` now, but managing image loaders with webpack still confuses me.

## Day 1: April 13, 2021

**Today's progress**: Implemented a website Vue component to load images in Markdown content, fine-tuned it to handle GIFs.

**Thoughts**: The simplest solution usually is to see if there's already a [module that does what I need](https://image.nuxtjs.org/) then modify it if needed  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
