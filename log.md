# 100 Days Of Code &ndash; Log

## Week 0

### Day 0: April 12, 2021

**Today's progress:** Altered my website's Vue icon component to import SVGs automatically.

**Thoughts:** I need a regex refresher.
I can make sense of `require.context()` now, but managing image loaders with webpack still confuses me.

### Day 1: April 13, 2021

**Today's progress:** Implemented a website Vue component to load images in Markdown content, fine-tuned it to handle GIFs.

**Thoughts:** The simplest solution usually is to see if there's already a [module that does what I need](https://image.nuxtjs.org/) then modify it if needed  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

### Day 2: April 14, 2021

**Today's progress:** Mostly organizational and cleanup work.
Structured my Transfermarkt webscraper into a proper Python project, which can now be imported as a module or run as a script.

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot about how Python modules and packages are structured.
Although writing up full documentation and setup for something simple or "self-explanatory" initially seemed excessive, I see the benefit in how readily extendable the webscraper is now.
