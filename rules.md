# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment

_I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days._

## Start Date

April 12, 2021

## Additional Rules

1. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
2. I will update the [Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
3. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
